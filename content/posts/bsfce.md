Bulletstorm contains a number of characters from Duke Nukem 3D which can be found hidden in various levels throughout the game.
In May 2020 I extracted all of the textures from Bulletstorm. So far this has lead to the discovery of 2 new easter eggs which had never been seen before.
This guide will provide locations and screenshots for the secret characters so you can locate them in-game if you wish.
All the characters found so far can be seen from within the game bounds during normal gameplay. However some are easier to see using the Camera Unlocker tool.
The screenshots in this article were taken using the Camera Unlocker tool.

## Act 0: Chapter 1 - Duke Nukem  
![Easter Egg 1](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs1.jpg)

The first of our secrets can be found at the start of the game.

In the prologue during the skyscraper segment, as you begin walking down the building a elevator will descend on your left. Inside the elevator is Duke Nukem. This can be quite tricky to see in game due to the speed of the elevator.

The following video demonstrates the secret in-game

## Act 2: Chapter 1 - Pig Cop
![Easter Egg 2](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs2.jpg)

The Pig Cop can be found in the rooftop area, after you've finished fighting the enemies dropped off by helicopter.

Shortly after ascending some stairs to the rooftops, you will enter a room with a large glass window in the right hand side wall. Outside the far corner in a small alcove you can find the Pig Cop. To properly see this in-game you will need to smash some of the windows for a better view.

As far as I can tell this is the first time the Pig Cop secret has been documented.  

## Act 2: Chapter 1 - Duke Nukem and Pig Cop  
![Easter Egg 3](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs3.jpg)
Continue through the mission until you reach a small courtyard where you'll find Trishka's empty escape pod. Before going upstairs to continue with the mission, go to the back of the courtyard and check behind the stairs to find Duke Nukem and a Pig Cop.

## Act 2: Chapter 1 - Assault Trooper
![Easter Egg 4](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs4.jpg)
After discovering Trishka's empty escape pod you will go up a flight of stairs in the courtyard and then into a building. You will reach a staircase back down to the ground floor, where you'll need to hop over a wooden beam to continue down. Before heading down look straight ahead to find the Assault Trooper on the far wall.

## Act 2: Chapter 2 - Alien Queen
![Easter Egg 5](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs5.jpg)
Here is probably the most interesting of the easter eggs, unlike the others it requires interacting with a hidden switch, which will cause the nearby screens to display images of the Alien Queen.

Right at the start of the mission, head to the third pillar, right hand side:

​
Behind it you will find a small switch near the floor. The switch texture itself is also from Duke Nukem 3D. Press `R` to interact with the switch - it will visually change if done so successfully:

Activating the switch changes all the nearby hologram screens to display images of the Alien Queen and Duke Nukem:

## Act 3: Chapter 1 - Octabrain
![Easter Egg 10](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs10.jpg)

Progress normally through the mission until you reach a corridor with a large fish tank that covers the entire left-hand side wall. It can be difficult to see in-game, but swimming at the far back of the fish tank is an Octabrain.

Act 3: Chapter 1

## Act 6: Chapter 1 - Holoduke
![Easter Egg 11](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs11.jpg)
Throughout the start of the mission you will go down a few flights of stairs until you reach a large room featuring dining tables and chairs, with a grand piano centrepiece near the far wall.

To the right of the piano platform you will find a Holoduke on one of the tables.

I found this in Chapter 6 Act 1.... Hail to the King, Baby!!!

## The Hunt Continues?  
![Easter Egg 12](/img/bsfce/bsfceeggs12.png)
The Pig Cop's existence was discovered when I was extracting the game's texture files and spotted the Pig Cop texture with a reference to "Outskirts_Rooftops". After searching through Act 2: Chapter 1 I confirmed that the Pig Cop is actually present in the game.

There could potentially be more undiscovered secrets to find in Bulletstorm. I have yet to completely unpack all of the game's textures, when I have done this I will update the guide with my findings and should be able to confirm whether there are any easter eggs left to find.

  
----------
### Update 2 - 30/05/2020
A second new easter egg has now been located in-game after finding related textures in the game files!

### Update - 29/05/2020
All game textures are now extracted. After looking through them I believe there are a handful of undiscovered easter eggs to find in Bulletstorm. More information to follow soon once we've managed to locate these in-game!
